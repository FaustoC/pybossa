         <p><strong>The GeoTag-X pilot project</strong> will teach volunteers to perform in-depth analyses of the media (photos, video, and audio) coming out of a disaster. </p>
<p>Disaster response efforts have to analyse massive amounts of data that are produced during a crisis, an overwhelmingly difficult task. Crowd-sourcing has already been used during different events to help filter, categorise, and map this data, and has proved to be an invaluable resource.</p>

Geotag-X is a research project that will assess if we can teach you, our volunteers, to recognise the important information in a photo and create relevant, structured datasets that can be used by those working on the ground in the response. In the end, we want to know if Geotag-X could be a useful tool in an operational context.<br> 
In order to assess this we have set up a series of pilot projects covering different disaster related events. Disasters could include earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, along with more slow moving events such as drought, climate change, and pollution. Analyses in our pilot projects therefore could cover topics as diverse as environmental conditions, health, agriculture, and engineering. <br>
<br><strong>How do I get started?</strong><br>
Geotag-X is still under development however there are two ways you can volunteer<br>
1) <a href="{{url_for('find_photos')}}">Find Photos</a> <br>
2) <a href="{{url_for('analyse_photos')}}">Analyse Photos</a>  <br>

We also really need your feedback! You can post it on <a href="https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues">GitHub</a> or use the <a href="http://tecfalabs.unige.ch/survey/index.php/471228/lang-en">feedback form</a>.<br><br>

We also welcome collaborators for new  GeoTag-X projects, such as organisations or researchers addressing a particular crisis.<br><br>

We are also researching how visitors learn through their interactaction with Geotag-X and the projects on it, to be part of this project make sure you sign up for an account and accept to be part of the research project. If you are interested in why we are doing this you can learn more at <a target="_blank" href="http://citizencyberlab.eu/">Citizen Cyberlab</a>.<br>
