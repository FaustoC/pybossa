		<h1>How {{brand}} uses cookies</h1>

            <p>A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.</p>
            <p>In the following video from Google,  you can see a very good explanation about how cookies work:</p>

        <h2>Disabling cookies</h2>
        <p>However, if you want to disable the cookies in this site or other, we recommend you to check the help section of your web browser so you can disable them.</p>
		
		<h1>Private Logging on {{brand}}</h1>
		<p>{{brand}} uses Google Analytics, which is a cookie that collects information on visitors to the website. By accessing this site, certain information about the visitor will be collected such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the site, the software used and the time spent on the site, along with other similar information. This information will not specifically identify individual visitors. The information collected in this way will be used internally to analyse what people are doing on the site with the aim of improving {{brand}}</p>
		<p>If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics, Google has developed a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser add-on</a> that will prevent your data being collected by Google Analytics </p>
